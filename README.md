# TelegramBotTest
This project designed to be a chatbot, for the first time I try socket programming with chatAI which I got the source code of internet.
I learned paralel programming and socket programming with this project. I didn't share the AI source code because I didn't find the proper NLTK tool for my native language and I got UTF-8 encoding problem, characters only send in ascii. I made this project in 2021.
